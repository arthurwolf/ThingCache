ThingCache
==========

A set of scripts to make a local copy of CADÂ model sharing websites for Fablabs and machine controllers

## Project goals

Grab CAD files and related metadata, and insert it into a database and a file repository

There is no plan at the moment to make this easy to deploy, though a bit of knowledge about Perl and Mysql should make it fairly easy to deploy.
